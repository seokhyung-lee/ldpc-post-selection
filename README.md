# ldpc-post-selection

**Python package for decoding quantum LDPC codes with cluster-based post-selection**, which is an approach introduced in the paper ["Efficient Post-Selection for General Quantum LDPC Codes"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05795).

## Introduction

In quantum error correction, **post-selection** is a powerful technique to boost the effective fidelity of a computation by discarding low-confidence results. However, the representative **[logical gap](https://doi.org/10.1103/PRXQuantum.5.010302) (or [complementary gap](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59714-1)) method** faces major obstacles: it can be computationally expensive (scaling exponentially with the number of logical qubits) and is limited to specific codes like the surface code that allow the MWPM decoder.

[Our work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05795) introduces a new approach to overcome these limitations. We've developed **efficient heuristic decoding confidence metrics based on error cluster statistics from clustering-based decoders (such as [BP+LSD](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-63214-7)) and utilized them for post-selection**.

Key accomplishments include:
- **General Applicability:** Our method works for a broad range of quantum low-density parity check (QLDPC) codes, not just surface codes.
- **Drastic Error Reduction:** We demonstrate orders of magnitude reduction in logical error rates with only modest abort rates. For example, with the [[144, 12, 12]] bivariate bicycle code, we achieve a ~1000x reduction in the memory logical error rate with just a 1% abort rate at a physical error rate of 0.1%.
- **Real-Time Integration:** We integrated our strategy with real-time decoding via the sliding-window framework, featuring early mid-circuit abort decisions. Crucially, this shows performance that matches or even surpasses global decoding strategies, exhibiting favorable scaling in the number of rounds.

Our post-selection strategies are expected to be particularly useful for offline resource state generation processes (such as magic state preparation) with QLDPC codes.

## Installation

Requires Python >= 3.11

**WARNING:** Itâ€™s strongly recommended to use a virtual environment.

cd ldpc-post-selection
pip install -e .
# Optional: install codes used for the numerical analyses in our paper.
pip install -e ./simulations
```
